### **Animal and Bird Interference Detection System**  

Welcome to the **Animal and Bird Interference Detection System** repository! This open-source project aims to tackle a critical issue in power infrastructure: **minimizing power outages caused by animal and bird interference in substations**. By leveraging AI and real-time video analysis, this system helps identify potential threats and prevent outages, ensuring a more reliable power supply.  

---

#### **ðŸ“œ Project Overview**  
Substations often experience power disruptions due to the interference of specific animals and birds. This project proposes a solution to:  
- Monitor live video feeds from cameras installed in substations.  
- Detect and identify animals and birds from predefined categories that pose a threat.  
- Generate **real-time alerts** with detailed information, including:  
  - Facility ID  
  - Camera ID  
  - Species identified (animal/bird)  
  - Event timestamps (start and end)  
  - Duration of the event  
  - Optional: Save flagged video clips for ease of access.

#### **ðŸš€ Key Features**  
- **Real-Time Detection**: AI-powered detection of animals and birds from live video feeds.  
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive alerts with detailed metadata for each detected event.  
- **Data Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of flagged video segments for up to two months (if possible).  
- **Customizability**: Adaptable to different camera setups and lighting conditions.
